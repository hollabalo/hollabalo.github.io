Joined the contact center team that primary handled IVRS related systems. Notable achievements are:
- Dramatically reduced prepaid mobile reload fraud rate as a result of the API that was created from scratch that mitigated fraud via PIN based security
- Created a fullstack web application from scratch that enabled IVRS administrators to change the system parameters on the fly using the web-based GUI.
